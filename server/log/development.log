Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound (
message:
  Document(s) not found for class Note with id(s) root.
summary:
  When calling Note.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): root ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: root.
resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

  Document(s) not found for class Note with id(s) temp_6698.
summary:
  When calling Note.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): temp_6698 ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: temp_6698.
resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

  Document(s) not found for class Note with id(s) 5fd4fa9c326d76dead4488fc.
summary:
  When calling Note.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 5fd4fa9c326d76dead4488fc ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 5fd4fa9c326d76dead4488fc.
resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

summary:
  When calling Note.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 5fd5bbfb326d765af68d348e ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 5fd5bbfb326d765af68d348e.
resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):
